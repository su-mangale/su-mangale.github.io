Hi! I'm **Su Mangale**, a DevOps enthusiast passionate about:

- Kubernetes (designing, deploying, and managing containerized workloads)
- FluxCD (GitOps workflows for continuous delivery)
- Nutanix Kubernetes Platform (operating Nutanix-based K8s clusters)
- Jenkins (CI/CD pipelines for automation)
- Git (version control best practices)

I love automating workflows, building scalable infrastructure, and sharing my knowledge with the community.
