FluxCD is a powerful GitOps tool for Kubernetes that enables continuous and automated deployment of your workloads using Git as the source of truth. In this post, we'll cover the basics of setting up FluxCD and deploying your first application using GitOps principles.

## What is GitOps?

GitOps is a modern approach to continuous delivery where Git repositories are the single source of truth for your infrastructure and application definitions. Changes to your cluster are made by updating Git, and automation tools like FluxCD reconcile your cluster state to match Git.

## Why FluxCD?

- Declarative and automated Kubernetes deployments
- Easy integration with existing Git workflows
- Supports Helm, Kustomize, and plain YAML
- Strong security and multi-tenancy features

## Basic Setup Steps

1. Install FluxCD CLI and bootstrap your cluster
2. Connect your Git repository
3. Define your Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts in Git
4. Let FluxCD reconcile your cluster automatically
